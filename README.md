# **Project: Typing Speed Test**

## **Project Overview**
The Typing Speed Test is a simple command-line Python game that challenges users to type randomly selected words as quickly and accurately as possible. It measures the time taken to type the word correctly and encourages users to improve their typing speed.

## **Purpose**
- Assess and improve typing speed and accuracy.
- Provide a simple and engaging way to practice typing.
- Offer instant feedback on typing performance.

## **Features**
- **Random Word Selection:** The program selects a random word from a predefined list.
- **Typing Challenge:** The user is prompted to type the displayed word as quickly as possible.
- **Time Tracking:** Measures the time taken to type the word.
- **Accuracy Check:** Compares the typed word with the given word to determine correctness.
- **Replay Option:** Users can play multiple rounds to improve their typing speed.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `random` (for selecting random words)
  - `time` (for tracking typing speed)

## **How It Works**
1. **Start the Test:** The program displays a welcome message and waits for the user to press Enter.
2. **Word Display:** A random word is shown on the screen.
3. **Typing Challenge:** The user types the word as quickly as possible.
4. **Time Calculation:** The time taken to type the word is recorded.
5. **Result Display:** The program checks if the word is typed correctly and displays the result along with the time taken.
6. **Replay Option:** The user can choose to play again or exit the game.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add a difficulty level with different word lengths.
- Implement a leaderboard to track high scores.
- Provide detailed statistics, including average speed and accuracy over multiple attempts.
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.

This project is a fun and engaging way to practice typing skills while tracking improvements over time. ðŸš€
